Welcome to my 7-day journey into the world of **React**!

This repo documents my hands-on learning as I explore:
- JSX & Components
- Props & State
- React Hooks like `useState` and `useEffect`
- Event handling, conditional rendering, and lists
- Routing and project structure
- And a small final project to wrap it up!

## Why this repo?
I'm diving deep into React to level up my frontend skills, build cool UI, and have fun while doing it.

Feel free to clone, fork, or just vibe with the code.

**Day 1**: First components and props  
**Day 2**: State + events  
... and more coming soon!

Stay tuned!
